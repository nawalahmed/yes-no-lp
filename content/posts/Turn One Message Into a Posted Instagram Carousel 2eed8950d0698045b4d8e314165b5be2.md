# Turn One Message Into a Posted Instagram Carousel

(make ai + google slides + google gemini + custom agent)

![workflow-for-ig-carousel.png](public/images/workflow-for-ig-carousel.png)

---

## Overview

This workflow turns a single message or idea into a fully posted Instagram carousel. It handles research, viral hook generation, copywriting, image creation with customized text, and scheduling automatically.

The goal is simple. Remove manual work. Eliminate guesswork. Ship high quality content every single day.

Instead of spending hours brainstorming hooks, writing copy, designing slides, and posting manually, you drop one message into the system. The workflow does everything else.

---

## The Core Problem It Solves

Creating consistent Instagram content is expensive, slow, and mentally draining.

- Hiring designers, copywriters, and social media managers adds up fast.
- Manually researching viral posts wastes hours every week.
- Weak hooks kill reach before the post even has a chance.
- Inconsistent posting breaks momentum.
- Creative burnout stops growth completely.

This workflow replaces the entire content production pipeline with one automated system.

---

## What the Workflow Does

From a single input message, the system:

1. Analyzes what is already winning in your niche.
2. Uses a **custom AI agent** to extract and rewrite viral hooks.
3. Generates a structured carousel script.
4. Creates on brand images with customized text for each slide.
5. Writes captions and hashtags optimized for reach.
6. Schedules and posts content automatically on a daily basis.

No manual handoffs. No design tools. No context switching.

## The Custom Viral Hooks Agent

At the core of this workflow is a **custom AI agent built specifically for viral hook generation**.

### What the Agent Does

- Scans recent high performing Instagram posts in your niche.
- Identifies hooks with strong engagement signals.
- Breaks hooks down by pattern, structure, and intent.
- Rewrites hooks to match your topic, tone, and audience.
- Ranks hooks based on clarity, curiosity, and scroll stopping power.

These hooks are not guessed or generated randomly. They are derived from content that is already performing right now.

This is what makes the workflow consistently outperform manual posting.

---

## How the Carousel Is Generated

Once the top hooks are selected, the carousel is built automatically.

Each slide is written for mobile consumption. Short lines. High contrast. Zero fluff.

---

## Image Creation With Customized Text

Each carousel slide includes a generated image with customized text.

- Every slide gets its own visual.
- Text is dynamically placed on the image.
- Layout and style remain consistent across all posts.
- Branding stays clean and recognizable.

This removes the need for Canva, designers, or manual formatting.

---

## Caption or Hashtag Automation

The workflow generates captions that support the carousel instead of repeating it.

- Captions reinforce the main idea.
- Optimized for saves, shares, and profile visits.
- The text is generated based on niche, topic, and intent.

Everything is ready to publish with zero edits.

---

## Daily Posting Automation

Once the content is generated, automation takes over.

- Posts are scheduled in advance.
- Content goes live daily without reminders.
- Posting happens even when you are offline.

Consistency becomes automatic.
